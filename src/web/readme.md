# Survey Web interface

## Usage
Web version of Survey is runnable only through [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org) server. You need to upload it first to the server to run it. More information is in [wiki](https://github.com/hermajan/survey/wiki/Web-interface).

### Instalation
* Download `survey_web.war` archive with the web interface from [Releases](https://github.com/hermajan/survey/releases).
* Upload content of the archive to the Apache Tomcat server to the `webapps` folder.
* Start the Tomcat server with script:
	* `bin/startup.sh` (on Linux)
	* `bin/startup.bat` (on Windows)
* In `content.js` is an option which implementation is used for processing answers on the server:
	* <attr title="JavaServer Pages">JSP</attr>: set variable `implementation` to `jsp`
	* <attr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</attr>: set variable `implementation` to `php`
* Open the `index.html` file in the browser with URL of your server.
